On our website, you can view and send anonymous kind messages to others around the world! This is a simple yet powerful website that grows in usefulness as more people use it, and we want to help people give the gift of kindness: just a few words can make someone’s day.

## How we came up with the idea:

Well we thought that it was necessary to spread kindness towards our internet community. The internet often has a negative connotation when it comes to the damaging side effects of social media and the ever-increasing cyberbullying occurrences. With this in mind, we thought about creating a platform in which people could anonymously spread kindness and love to other internet users, which ultimately led us to the creation of KindSound!

## Our Mission:

Sometimes, all it takes is a kind word to make someone’s day. We wanted to provide a moment of peace for those who are struggling mentally and emotionally and let them know that even strangers in a wide, wide world do care

## Features:

1. NodeJS & ExpressJS backend
2. React Frontend 
3. AI model for sentiment tracking
4. Like / Dislike algorithm in backend to suggest quotes

## How to use:

1. Run npm start on the client folder to run frontend react application
2. Run npm start on the server folder to start the port 5000 node js server
3. That's it! Have fun!
